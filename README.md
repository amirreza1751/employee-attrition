**Employee Attrition: A Supervised Learning
Approach to Predict Whether Employees Will
Leave Their Current Company**

Many employees leave their current company, while managers often
perceive this as an impulsive decision. However, numerous factors
influence an employee’s attrition and performance in their role. In
this study, we aim to identify the most important factors affecting
an employee’s performance and predict whether they are at risk of
attrition. We explore and visualize the attrition rate in relation to the
available factors provided by the IBM HR Analytics dataset [1]. to
gain a better understanding of the data. We then apply a supervised
learning algorithm (SVM) to predict whether an employee is likely to
leave their current company. Our SVM model achieved an accuracy of
78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting employee attrition.
